# InfoSupportSanne
 
Welcome! This is my take on the InfoSupport Course Client.

Let's get started.

There are a few things that need to be initialised before this project can run.

Let's start with the WebApi. It is written code first, so it will create the database for us. 

WEBAPI
On opening the InfoSupportSanne\RestAPI\RestAPI.sln with Visual Studio you will have to:
1. Open the Package Manager Console
2. Enter update-database; this will create the database for us.

AngularClient
On opening \InfoSupportSanne\AngularInfoSupport in Visual Studio Code you will have to:
1. Open the terminal and write: npm install 
1. This will install all used packages for us
2. Open the terminal and write: ng serve
2. This will initiate our client which will be reachable at http://localhost:4200/
